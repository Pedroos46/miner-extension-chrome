This is an example of a monero miner extension for Chrome. Educational use onlyðŸŒš.

Simple and basic example of a background monero miner extension, using the public API of CoinHive. There's no interface, everything runs in background and its controlled via Firebase.

You will need to create a new Firebase project and get the api keys from CoinHive and Firebase. Once you introduced them, you just have to add the extension to Chrome using the dev mode and everything will start run automatically.
