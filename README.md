# Monero Miner Extension for Chrome

This is an example of a monero miner extension for Chrome. Educational use onlyðŸŒš.

Simple and basic example of a background monero miner extension, using the public API of CoinHive. As I said it's everything in background so there's no interface, everything its controlled via Firebase.

So if you want to run it, you will need to create a new Firebase project and get the api keys from CoinHive and Firebase. Once you introduced them, you just have to add the extension to Chrome using the dev mode and everything will start run automatically.
